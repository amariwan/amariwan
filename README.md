### Boy Scout Rule

I love open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the boyscout rule.  I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with.  This may be things that are overlooked by someone who is deep into the library.  I 💕 a good onboarding readme with good example.

### My Digital Garden 🌱

I've cultivated a digital garden where I regularly publish blog posts on topics that I'm passionate about. Most of my writings can be found on my personal website [aland-mariwan.de](https://aland-mariwan.de).

My motivation for writing is rooted in my desire to share knowledge and help others. I believe that learning is a continuous journey, and I want to contribute to the growth and development of fellow developers and learners.

I cover a variety of topics in my blog posts, including those I'm deeply familiar with, common stumbling blocks I've encountered while mentoring others, and the latest concepts and technologies I'm learning. 

My day-to-day work involves creating meaningful projects with **data**, utilizing the power of **Python** and **Javascript** to analyze, visualize, and derive insights from datasets.

If you're interested in exploring my thoughts and insights, feel free to check out my [latest blog post](https://aland-mariwan.de/blog.php). I hope you find something valuable and thought-provoking in my digital garden.

<h2>👨🏽‍💻 Talking about Personal Stuffs:</h2>

<p style="font-size:16px">
  👨🏻‍🎓 I have successfully completed my education at OSZ Teltow, where I studied [Name deines Studienfachs]. Education has been a valuable part of my journey, and now I'm ready to apply my knowledge and skills in the real world.

  😊 Lifelong learning is a core value for me. I believe in continually seeking opportunities to grow and develop, both personally and professionally.

  ⚡ Fun fact: In my free time, I enjoy Singing Rap 🎧 and diving into Books 📕 related to Security & Hacking. Additionally, I have a deep passion for playing Independent games 🎮, where I discover unique and innovative gaming experiences.

  👯 I’m always open to collaboration, whether it's contributing to open source projects or working on exciting commercial endeavors. Feel free to reach out if you have a project in mind or just want to connect.

  💬 Don't hesitate to ask me about anything! I'm here to help and engage in meaningful conversations with fellow developers and enthusiasts.
</p>

## 🚀 What I Like:

I have a profound affection for coding in **Python**, and here's why it's my programming language of choice:

* **Simple Syntax**: Python's clean and elegant syntax is a joy to work with. It reads like poetry and allows me to express complex ideas in a readable and concise manner.

* **Efficiency**: Python's power lies in its ability to accomplish a lot with just a few lines of code. It's the Swiss Army knife of programming languages, helping me turn concepts into functional code rapidly.

* **Automation**: Python excels at automating mundane and repetitive tasks, making it an invaluable tool in modern software development. It's the engine that drives efficiency.

When I'm in the coding flow, I find solace in the rhythms of music. 🎵 Whether it's the soothing melodies of classical compositions or the electric beats of electronic tunes, music is my creative companion during coding adventures.

To maintain focus and productivity, I adhere to a well-structured daily routine. 📝 Keeping track of tasks and goals ensures that I navigate through the day with precision, turning chaos into order.

Python, to me, is not just a programming language; it's a medium of creativity and innovation. It excels in:

* **Speedy Development**: Python enables rapid prototyping and swift development, transforming ideas into reality.

* **Powerful Primitives**: With its rich set of built-in data types and libraries, Python simplifies complex operations and unleashes the full potential of programming.

* **Readability**: Python code reads like executable pseudocode, making collaboration a breeze and maintenance a pleasure.

* **Building Games**: I've even ventured into the realm of game development using Python, crafting interactive experiences that bring joy to players.

In my coding journey, Python is the brush I use to paint the canvas of possibilities. It's more than a language; it's a creative outlet. 🎨
