### Boy Scout Rule

I love open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the boyscout rule.  I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with.  This may be things that are overlooked by someone who is deep into the library.<br>I 💕 a good onboarding readme with good example.

### My Digital Garden 🌱

I write regular blog posts, most of which you will find on my personal website [aland-mariwan.de](https://aland-mariwan.de).

I write about things I am familiar with, things that trip up folks that I mentor, and things that I am learning.  Day to day I make things with **data** using **python** and **javascript**.

<h2> 👨🏽‍💻Talking about Personal Stuffs:</h2>

## What I like:
I love coding in python for many reasons. Here are some:
  * Simple syntax
  * Ability to do a lot with just a few lines of code
  * Makes automization really easy  
  
I also like listening to music while coding. It helps me relax  
and (or) concentrate a lot.
I need to be organized all the time so I usually have most of my day written  
down somewhere so that I don't get lost in my thought - this kind of means I like  
being organized?  
  
I also like coding in Java because:
 * I can create minecraft mods, which are fun and people like to use them
 * Really interesting to me, I like the syntax  
 * Can be challenging and still look great even with more complicated syntax
